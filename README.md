This repository demonstrates a common mistake in Dockerfiles: using an unstable base image and not cleaning up temporary files.  The original Dockerfile uses `ubuntu:latest`, which can lead to inconsistent builds.  The improved version specifies a precise version, adds a `RUN apt-get clean && apt-get autoremove` step for cleanup, and uses a multi-stage build for a smaller final image.  The application itself is a simple Python script that prints 'Hello from Docker!'
